# LAP 4 Debugging Assignment

Welcome to your fourth and final debugging assignment! This is a Flask-powered user interface for a rudimentary prediction model.

**Please make sure that you read _all_ the instructions before starting.**

You are going to debug and complete an app called LegOh!

- Users can see a short blurb about the app on the front page
- Users can provide a number of Lego pieces that they want in their next kit
- Users cannot click the ENT button if piece input is under 20
- Users receive an estimation of the kit cost
- User can provide an email address to recieve and email summarising their result
- User cannot click the receipt button if email address is not filled in or result is 0

To complete this debug in full, you may need to make adjustments to not only the python files.

**Take your time to familiarise yourself with the structure of this app before you start debugging.**
