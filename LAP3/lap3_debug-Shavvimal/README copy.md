# LAP 3 Debugging Assignment

Welcome to your third debugging assignment!
As before, this repo is riddled with bugs. This one is going to be a bit more of a 'treasure hunt' with less hints on what is required. Run the code and follow the errors to find all the bugs. Remember that useful errors may show up in various places such as browser dev tools, test runs and more! Use the demo gif as a reference to the intended behaviour.

**Please make sure that you read all the instructions before starting.**

**NB: This code makes use of 2 external APIs. There is a chance that we may overload them with requests and start getting bad responses - but hopefully not! If it happens, it makes the debug a bit more interesting but by no means unacheivable! You will know if this happens by checking your network tab and/or dev tools console for errors.**


## Code of Conduct
- Do not ask your classmates (verbally or through any other communication method) for help.
- Do not copy/paste any code from someone else or from any online resource.


## Tasks
You are going to debug an app called *Sunrise, Sunset*. Users can search for a location name and they receive the time of today's sunrise and sunset in that location. On initial load, the search page should show results for London. When you are finished with the app, it should look something like this:

### Unit Tests
- Ensure the test suite is able to run bug-free
- All tests should be passing by the end of your debugging session
- ***NB: You do not need to make any changes to the test suites themselves or the setupTests.js***

### React
- Ensure the React app can mount and load successfully
- Ensure any data is being passed around appropriately
- Ensure any inputs follow a controlled pattern
- See the screen cap above for intended behaviour

### Redux
- Ensure data is accessible from the store to the React application
- Ensure the reducer is working as expected


### README
- Add a useful README to document your work, take a look at [this guide](https://gist.github.com/getfutureproof-admin/dfe45adba508f931bf83d144cbbf6bbe) on assignment specific requirements.
